      We're pleased to announce that the conference schedule is extended for 2016!
      This year's conference will <strong>run over three</strong> days, with a
      more <em>business of scale</em> oriented day running first on the
      Wednesday. More details of the schedule for the first day will be
      released soon.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Business of Scale day focuses on the issues leaders and their teams face
      when growing a technology-driven organisation. You'll get to hear from those
      who've faced the challenges of building engineering teams, growing healthy
      customer acquisition strategies, maintaining inspiring working environments,
      balancing customer demands and technical debt, dealing with exit
      opportunities and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <strong>tried and tested</strong> formula will be repeated for the
      second two days, with a total of <strong>12 x 45 minute talks</strong> plus
      regular breaks to keep the legs from falling asleep and awesome lunches to
      feed the mind and body.
    </p>

    <p>
      There will be <strong>three social events</strong> starting with the
      Wednesday evening with a sponsored drinks event in the city. Then similar
      events on the Thursday and Friday nights. These are a chance to socialise
      and network with the speakers, organisers, and fellow conference attendees.
