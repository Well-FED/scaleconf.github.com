        name: Craig Robinson
        company: Google
        role: Senior Software Engineer
        country: USA
        bio: >
            is Senior Software engineer on the Street View team at Google. After
            finishing a PhD in control theory (with a fair dose of CS) he spent
            some time developing <a
            href="http://news.discovery.com/tech/videos/tech-green-light-for-robotic-roads.htm">wireless
            vehicle to vehicle communication</a> applications for Mercedes-Benz
            Research and Development.  In 2009 he joined Street View and started
            work on estimating panorama location and orientation using onboard
            sensors (GPS, IMU, laser, wheels), computer vision (feature matches,
            loop closing), map matching and other hackery. He enjoys the fact that
            it's a multi-dimensional project that is both enabled and challenged by
            its scale. When he is not enjoying it, he goes running.
        title: Street View Scale
        abstract: >
            Google Street View began with a single video camera hand held by Larry
            Page. It launched in 2007 and covered 5 cities. Since then it has grown
            to span 7 continents and over 50 countries with 5 million unique miles
            driven and 20 petabytes of imagery captured. Collections now include
            indoor, underwater, snowmobile, backpack and bicycle. The scaling up
            has been a logistics and a software challenge and we will cover some of
            the highlights, low lights, software architectures and lessons learned
            in Street View and Google at large.

            Simon enjoys exploring details and finding ways to make the world a better place.
            From a childhood filled with weekends on the rocky beaches of South Africa’s west
            coast and fortuitous early access to the GW-BASIC reference manual, he made his way
            through high school and into academia, where he spent a lot of time learning details
            like quantum mechanics and general relativity. Somehow he completed an MSc in Applied
            Mathematics, despite discovering the wonders of Linux and open-source software in
            the middle. Since leaving academia, Simon has written code for a variety of commercial
            and scientific projects ranging from online newspapers to petrochemical companies and
            from bioinformatics to radio astronomy. In his spare time Simon contributes to and
            maintains a number of open source software projects, writes the odd computer game
            or two, engages in old-fashioned pen-and-paper gaming and tries to get out to the
            swimming pool or squash court every now and then. Simon is currently the lead
            developer of Vumi, a scalable mobile messaging platform developed by the Praekelt
            Foundation and recently organized the first two PyConZA conferences.

        title: Caching and Tuning fun for high scalability
        abstract: >
            Caching has been a 'hot' topic for a few years. But caching takes more than merely taking
            data and putting it in a cache : the right caching techniques can improve performance and
            reduce load significantly. But we'll also look at some major pitfalls, showing that
            caching the wrong way can bring down your site. If you're looking for a clear explanation
            about various caching techniques and tools like Memcached, Nginx and Varnish, as well as
            ways to deploy them in an efficient way, this talk is for you.

            Performance improvements in modern browsers coupled with the acceptance of javascript
            as a first class language gives us a compelling platform to move a bulk of what used
            to be done earlier on the server side to the client. This allows the distribution of
            processing power and removing some obvious bottlenecks on the server side. This talk
            aims to share our experience with the advantages of using this approach along with its
            limitations. We talk about single page web applications, client side consumption of
            RESTful services, performance gotchas, single code base for designers and developers
            and its effect on building a portable client and scalable server code.

        bio: >
            is an African software developer, by birth, by choice
            and for life.  He believes that all of software is just design and values code
            as an expression of design. The same goes for architecture too - it''s all design.
            The one thing he has learnt, though, is that design is hard, very, very hard,
            because achieving a harmonious balance is difficult.  The same with scalability
            - it throws us into extreme states, way off balance.  That is the challenge
            - finding a new equilibrium.  You can read his blog at http://f3yourmind.net
        title: Puppet for Human Beings (not!)
        abstract: >
            We can make servers look alike with Puppet, Chef, Ansible and most
            probably other machinery that we are going to invent.  And it makes us
            happy, because we like conformity and consistency.  Life is easier like
            that, we believe or hope.  Yet, at ScaleConf 2013, I noticed that every
            company that told their story increases people proportional to
            increases in servers.  How did that work out?  Did we make all people
            the same - like our servers? Do we want that in the first instance?
            And if we don't want clones, what do we want? How do we scale a culture
            if value diversity?  Which emerges first - consistency in values, or
            consistency in technology? What is the tail that is wagging a body?  I
            will explore these and other challenges - the really tough stuff that
            continuous delivery pipelines don't solve.  I hope you will help me
            answer those questions?  I believe that when we understand this, we can
            achieve scale and balance. That's what I'm after - equilibrium at
            scale.

        title: Scaling push notifications to millions of devices
        abstract: >
            Sending  notifications to millions of devices is quite challenging. Using
            native push notification services comes with the burdens of different APIs per
            platform, the need to manage the individual device registrations, the
            complexity of message personalization, and the need to massively scale when
            sending millions of notifications simultaneously. Notification hubs take a
            different approach: they're based on pub/sub and designed to elastically
            scale. They provide message templates for personalization and a single API
            across iOS, Android and Windows.

        abstract: >
            For Facebook’s 10 year anniversary, we produced over 700 million
            personalized “look back” videos. Without any marketing or promotions
            within Facebook, these videos were shared by hundreds of millions
            of people in the first two days. To make this happen, we scanned
            through billions of years of timelines and pre-rendered petabytes of
            videos. I’ll talk about how the videos were rendered and the systems
            used to scale it, how we managed to do this in just 3 weeks, including
            a few days for the infrastructure just to compute and store the output,
            and how Facebook's company culture enabled a group of relative
            strangers to band together and iterate quickly on solutions for this
            frankly herculean project.

        title: Scaling Deployment at Etsy
        abstract: >
            At Etsy we have over 100 engineers deploying more than 40 times a day. This
            culture of continuously deploying small change sets enables us to build and
            release robust features all while serving over a billion page views per month.
            In order to make sure we can keep up this pace, we have development and
            deployment infrastructure in place that makes it comfortable and simple to
            make changes. So simple that as an engineer at Etsy you deploy the site on
            your first day - even if you're a dog.
            </p>
            <p>
            But how is it possible to deploy so frequently among so many engineers and yet
            maintain a stable system? To answer this I give a high-level overview of the
            basic application structure to introduce the specific architecture we have at
            Etsy and how our development environment is set up. For development, every
            engineer gets their own VM with the full application stack configured. This
            makes it easy to get started and puts every developer in the same, familiar
            setup. This is a crucial part in removing confusion and ambiguity about how to
            work on and deploy changes.
            </p>
            <p>
            For the actual deployment we use a one-button deploy system - Deployinator -
            which we developed and opensourced. We integrated our system tightly with our
            company-wide IRC server and a set of tools we built to foster confidence,
            fast feedback and easy communication and collaboration between engineers. A
            detailed overview will be given on how the system works, how we use it and
            what problems we had to solve while making sure everyone can deploy as easily
            and fast as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
            The central source of confidence in our development process is our CI system.
            We have developed an easy way for developers to run tests on the CI cluster
            while developing to test changes before going into the deploy pipeline.
            Additionally tests are run on deploy and initiated by engineers with a tool
            called 'try' across 200 build machines. Our cluster setup is explained along
            with what problems we hit with an ever-growing codebase and number of
            engineers, and how we made our current setup fast.
            </p>
            <p>
            Continuous Deployment and the ability to quickly make changes are crucial for
            moving fast and iterating on products. Our deployment system works very well
            and is keeping up with the demands of a growing site and team. After attending
            this talk you will understand exactly how we approach Continuous Deployment
            and Continuous Integration at Etsy and get insight into what went wrong along
            the way and how we fixed it.

        abstract: >
            The BrandsEye team have spent the last year or so transitioning from a
            single monolithic application with serious performance issues into a
            loosely coupled collection of applications able to handle very much
            higher volumes at far greater reliability. The new system uses a lot of
            interesting technology (RabbitMQ, Redis, MongoDB, MySQL, Postgresql,
            Grails, Java, etc.) to solve various real-world problems. In this talk
            David goes into detail on the challenges and learnings encountered
            along the way.

        title: Performance Testing Crash Course
        abstract: >
            The performance of your application affects your business more than you might think.
            Top engineering organizations think of performance not as a nice-to-have, but as a
            crucial feature of their product. Those organizations understand that performance
            has a direct impact on user experience and, ultimately, their bottom line. Unfortunately,
            most engineering teams do not regularly test the performance and scalability of
            their infrastructure. Dustin Whittle shares the latest performance testing tools
            and insights into why your team should add performance testing to the development
            process. Learn how to evaluate performance and scalability on the server-side and
            the client-side with tools like Siege, Bees with Machine Guns, Google PageSpeed,
            WBench, and more. Take back an understanding of how to automate performance and
            load testing and evaluate the impact it has on performance and your business.

        title: Let's build a solid base for a scale.
        abstract: >
            Creating fast, reliable and easy to develop systems is not the easiest task.
            If you add the fact that thousands of companies use your system as a core business
            platform on a daily basis, it becomes challenging.
            </p>
            <p>
            Add a flavour of a scalability and millions of users and it moves on to exciting.
            How can we prepare a system that might be affected by scalability issues
            everywhere, even in the simplest component?
            </p>
            <p>
            The answer is to dive deep into the world of services.
            We decided to prepare a strong base on top of which we can build our
            system. Our choice was to start with the Java stack.
            We've gathered all the cool stuff from open source projects to create a bootstrap
            to let our developers create scalable services really fast.
            </p>
            <p>
            In this talk I would like to focus on the choices we made, and the
            ecosystem we built over our services.  It is not only about the code we
            write, but also the tools that make our life easier.  We will look at
            frameworks to provide REST services, and see how to make them auto
            discoverable.  We will also discuss tools to let us monitor and manage
            all the instancesi we run.  If you want to create or upgrade your service
            to scale it is the best place to start.

            Little teams with big results: NASA/JPL and Obama for America via AWS
        abstract: >
            In 2012 two small teams set about delivering on massive expectations, on
            "failure-is-not-an-option" projects, with extraordinarily limited time and
            resources. Both teams nailed it: every space geek in the world saw the Mars
            Curiosity Rover's first images live from Amazon S3 and Cloudfront and
            watched an HD live-stream of the event, and the 170+ custom applications on
            AWS powering the radical Obama for America campaign played no small part in
            helping President Obama win his bid for re-election.  Miles Ward, your

            testing, deployment and operational phases of these projects, and can relay

        title: Such Blocking, Very Concurrency, Wow
        abstract: >
            Concurrency is fundamentally at the base of scaling. How do you manage
            to do more things at once? Well, you do them at the same time. This opens
            a huge can of worms though, because every different approach to how you do
            this has disadvantages, weaknesses, problems and tradeoffs. I will go
            through some approaches to concurrency that I've come across, speak of
            common building blocks and issues that these approaches all share. I'll
            be mentioning things like the c10k problem, threads, actors, evented
            programming, interacting with IO, futures/promises, coroutines and more.

            Far from being a world-renowned expert on the matter, I will attempt to dissect
            these patterns and styles because I want to understand why they "scale,"
            problems you can run across, and when (pun intended!) it can drive you crazy.
            Hopefully by the end you will find it somewhat easier to understand and grasp,
            and have a newly driven passion to dig in further.

        title: Scale at the Square Kilometer Array
        abstract: >
            <p>
            Astronomy is one of the most scale obsessed of all the sciences.
            From our earliest attempts to understand the size of our planet through
            solar observations, through to our current appreciation of the ultimate
            scale of the universe, it constantly redefines our notion of "big".
            </p>
            <p>
            This escalation in scale can also be seen in our observational
            instruments, particularly in the field of radio astronomy. We are
            entering an epoch of massive expansion in observational capacity, which
            over the next 10 years we will see an 8 order of magnitude increase in
            the data volume being generated. This talk will focus on these
            instruments, their challenges, and what they will mean to the science
            of astronomy.
