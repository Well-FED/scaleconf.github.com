            <h1>About ScaleConf</h1>
            <p>
                ScaleConf is a two-day conference that brings together local and international
                experts to share their ideas on the problems faced by companies and individuals
                building and running services on the internet today.
            </p>
            <p>
                The presentations will cover the culture and methodologies used to architect and
                develop strong foundations required to operate websites and services.
            </p>
            <h4 class='padded'>A brief history</h4>
            <p>
            Having attended various conferences in the Bay Area (notably <a
                href="http://www.codeconf.com/">CodeConf</a> and <a
                href="http://devopsdays.org/">DevOpsDays</a>), Jonathan and
            Duncan found themselves wishing that there were more tech
            conferences of that calibre accessible locally.  At dinner one
            evening in October 2011, they decided that they would have to hold
            one themselves, and since their areas of expertise revolved around DevOps and high availability, the idea of ScaleConf was born.
            </p>
            <p>
            With Duncan leaving to work for Facebook in February 2012, they only had two and a half months to make the idea a reality.  Thanks to the expert
            help of Marije and Jen from <a href="http://lessfuss.co.za/">Lessfuss</a>, a bit of luck, and several willing speakers and sponsors, the conference
            happened on <a href="http://scaleconf.org/2012/">January 26th and 27th, 2012</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
            Due to the large number of people asking when it would happen again, and heartened by the other amazing tech conferences that are becoming regular
            events in South Africa, we are bringing ScaleConf back in April 2013.  Don't forget to check out <a href="http://www.jsinsa.com/">JSinSA</a>, <a href="http://rubyfuza.org/">rubyfuza</a>
            and <a href="http://za.pycon.org/">PyConZA</a> for more international-level events happening locally!
