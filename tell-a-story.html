                    Firstly, you get the awesome prize of making South Africa a better place! 
                    By spreading your experiences you will be helping a lot of people think
                    and approach problems differently than they might have previously. You
                    will help expose new technologies, or perhaps a new approach that hasn't
                    been on people's radar. It's also an opportunity to showcase yourself in the
                    community, giving yourself and your company prestige in a fast growing market.
