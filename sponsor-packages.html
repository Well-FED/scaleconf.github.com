    Sponsorship helps to keep our ticket prices low, as ScaleConf is organized by volunteers.
    If you'd like to sponsor, but none of these options suit you, get in touch with us at
    <a href="mailto:info@scaleconf.org">info@scaleconf.org</a> for more information.

    As well as conference sponsorships, there are a number of events around the conference
    which you may like to sponsor, either for exposure, or for networking purposes.

            Our premier sponsorship package is aimed at companies that would like the focus to 
            be on their brand for the majority of the conference. This sponsorship is ideal for companies 
            wishing to advertise their product, and raise awareness of their company offerings.

            Our second tier sponsorship package is for companies that wish to have a presence at the conference,

    <h2>Event</h2>
    
    <div class='first package'>
        <h1 class='tiny'>Pre-conference drinks</h1>
        <p>
        The night before the conference we like to have a small mixup where
        attendees get a chance to socialize and network. It builds up some
        excitement and gives everyone a chance to break out of their work week.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Credit on the event invite</li>

            <li>Small logo and paragraph on sponsors page</li>

    <div class='package'>
        <h1 class='tiny'>Dinners</h1>
        <p>
            We would like to have some small dinners on one of the conference
            nights, where people can meet people they may otherwise not have
            met. Each dinner will be about 12-16 people, and this gives a
            company an excellent opportunity to network with potential hires
            and other people in the industry.

            about what they've heard over a beer and some pizza.
