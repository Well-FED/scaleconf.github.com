    <p class='herotext' style="padding:20px 0 30px 0; width:850px;">
    ScaleConf is organised by volunteers, but there are still big expenses when
    it comes to putting together a successful conference. Sponsorship helps us
    to keep ticket prices affordable. If you'd like to sponsor, but none of
    these options suit you, get in touch with us at
    <a href="mailto:info@scaleconf.org">info@scaleconf.org</a>, and we can
    discuss how else you could be involved.
