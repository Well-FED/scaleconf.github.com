            ScaleConf is organised by volunteers, but there are still huge expenses when
            it comes to putting together a successful conference. Sponsorship helps us to
            keep ticket prices affordable.
        </p>
        <p>
            We've structured our sponsorship to make sure that you can build
            up the benefits in a way that makes sense for your company.
        </p>

        <p>If you want to take us up on one of the options then please send an email to <a href="mailto:info@scaleconf.org">info@scaleconf.org</a>.</p>

            recruiting talent, or raising awareness of their brand / product.</p>
