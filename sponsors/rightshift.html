      RightShift began life in 2005 as software developer for GoBLAM.com, a
      multiplayer tournament site for popular first person shooter (FPS) games.
      We then built the world’s first free- and pay-to-play FPS site to offer
      tournaments that could be played in a couple of hours or less, yet have
      thousands of concurrent players take part.

      Late 2007 we decided to work with Facebook to develop a social gaming app
      that combined the best of traditional online gaming with the virality and
      scale that world’s biggest social network delivers. After months of
      iterations, Clickfun Casino was born. Attracting millions of users per
      month, Clickfun has grown into an incredibly active and loyal social
      gaming community, with the app now also available on several mobile
      platforms, including iOS and Android.
