Speaker submissions for ScaleConf 2014 are now open!
</h2>

<p>ScaleConf will take place on the 10th and 11th of April, in Cape Town, South Africa. It is a 300 person, single-track conference, focussing on scalability and high availability on the internet today, the challenges faced when growing a company or service, and the technologies and methodologies we can use to mitigate these problems. There will be two days of talks, followed by full- or half-day workshops on the 12th and 13th.</p>

<p>We are currently accepting proposals for talks. If you would like to give a presentation, please submit your proposal using <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gdB_3A7t7pdqYHXob46_4svGnLsphJHJfAsqM81dcXM/viewform?embedded=true">this form</a>. The presentation slots will be 45 minutes long, including questions. The presentations will be in English.</p>

<p>The deadline for talk proposals is the 1st of March. Accepted presenters will be notified by no later than the 14th of March, although the earlier you submit your proposal, the earlier we can accept your talk.</p>

<p>In addition, if you wish to hold a workshop on a particular skill, technology, or product, please submit an outline to <a href="mailto:submit@scaleconf.org">submit@scaleconf.org</a>. The deadline for workshop submissions is the 1st of January. Workshops can be free, or paid-for.</p>
