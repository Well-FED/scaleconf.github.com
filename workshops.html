        <p>
            With such a strong technically focused conference, we have decided
            to run some free workshops alongside the conference.
            The workshops are informal hackathon-style workshops
            where the engineers from various companies will be on hand to
            walk you through getting started on their products.
        </p>
        <p>
        If you are interested in attending a workshop, please get your (free)
        tickets from the <a href='/purchase'>purchase page</a>.
