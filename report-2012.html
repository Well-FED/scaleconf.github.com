        In January of 2012, the very first conference focusing on Scalability <br/>
        in South Africa started.

    <p class='herotext'>
    <b>The idea was simple.</b> Bring in some of the finest international speakers and engineers to
        share their experience, and complement them with our own speakers that could give insight into
        problems that are being solved in Africa. It took just three months for Jonathan Hitchcock and
        Duncan Phillips to pull the conference together. Here is a breakdown of how it all happened.
