    <p class="big">
      Each year ScaleConf brings international and local experts
      together to share their experience scaling websites and services
      using modern technologies and philosophies. The presentations will cover
      the culture and methodologies used to architect and develop the strong
      foundations required to operate websites and services.

      <h2>Where it all started</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="row">
      <div class='col-md-6'>
        <p>
          Having attended various conferences in the Bay Area (notably CodeConf
          and Velocity), Jonathan and Duncan found themselves wishing that there
          were more tech conferences of that calibre accessible locally.
        </p>
        <p>
          At dinner one evening in October 2011, they decided that they would
          have to hold one themselves, and since their areas of expertise
          revolved around DevOps and high availability, the idea of ScaleConf
          was born.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class='col-md-6'>
        <p>
          With Duncan leaving to work for Facebook in February 2012, they only
          had two and a half months to make the idea a reality.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thanks to the expert help of Marije and Jen from Lessfuss, a bit of luck,
          and several willing speakers and sponsors, they organised the first
          conference, which was held on January 26 and 27, 2012.
