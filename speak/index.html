        <p>ScaleConf will take place in March 2016, in Cape Town, South Africa. It is a <strong>300-person</strong>, <strong>single-track</strong> conference, focusing on <strong>scalability and high availability</strong> on the internet today, the challenges faced when growing a company or service, and the technologies and methodologies we can use to mitigate these problems.</p>

        <p>There will be <strong>one day</strong> of business-oriented scaling talks, followed by <strong>two days</strong> of our usual technical talks. The Business of Scale day focuses on the issues leaders and their teams face when growing a technology-driven organisation. You'll get to hear from those who've faced the challenges of building engineering teams, growing healthy customer acquisition strategies, maintaining inspiring working environments, balancing customer demands and technical debt, dealing with exit opportunities and more.</p>
